# Netflix-Data-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a Netflix dataset and performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
I answered a few interesting questions about Netflix movies:

Q1: What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?

Q2: Which movie has the highest average votes?

Q3: What movie has the highest popularity and its genre?

Q4: What movie has the lowest popularity and its genre?

Q5: Which year had the most movies filmed?

The project focuses on simple analysis and data visualization to better understand Netflix's movie trends.
