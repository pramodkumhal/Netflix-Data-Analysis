# Netflix-Data-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a Netflix dataset and performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
I answered a few interesting questions about Netflix movies:

What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?

Which movie has the highest average votes?

What movie has the highest popularity and its genre?

What movie has the lowest popularity and its genre?

Which year had the most movies filmed?

The project is focused on understanding trends in Netflix movies through simple analysis and visualizations.
